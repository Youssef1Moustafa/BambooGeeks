Bank Marketing Model & Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains a bank marketing predictive model implemented using various machine learning algorithms and an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes important insights from the data.

Overview
The goal of the project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features from the bank's marketing dataset. The model is trained using machine learning techniques and the insights are visualized through a Power BI dashboard.

The dashboard provides visual insights into:

Customer demographics
Features affecting deposit decisions
Key patterns and trends in the marketing data
Machine Learning Models
The following models have been implemented to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Decision Tree
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various features such as:

Age
Job
Marital status
Education
Loan status
Previous campaign contact details
These features are used to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.

Models Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The most accurate models were the XGBoost and Random Forest, which achieved a higher prediction accuracy compared to others.
